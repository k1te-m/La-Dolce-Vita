          Growing up in the kitchen from an early age, the inspiration of
          watching my mother and grandmothers pass on traditions and techniques
          is the influence in the creation of our bakery.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for allowing me to share my passion with you and your loved
          ones and for all your support!
